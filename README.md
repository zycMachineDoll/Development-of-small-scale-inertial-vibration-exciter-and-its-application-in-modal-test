# Development-of-small-scale-inertial-vibration-exciter-and-its-application-in-modal-test
On the engineering background of the modal tests of bridges, we develop a exciter, aiming to solve some deficiencies of ordinary exciters. The device is made of stepping motor, motor driver, motor controller, gear set, counter-rotating dual-rotor and base. According to the modal test of a long-span suspension bridge model, the resonance modal frequency is confirmed by the frequency in which the dynamic magnification factor is maximum, and the test results of inertial vibration exciter are compared with those of numerical calculation of ANSYS and hammering test, proving that this new small-scale inertial vibration exciter is applicative to the modal tests of bridge models. With the advantages of lightness, small volume and precisely controllable frequency of force, this exciter not only is applicative in modal tests of bridge models but also provides new idea and method for experiments teaching as well as excitation of real bridges
